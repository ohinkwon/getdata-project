The goal of this project is to prepare tidy dataset from *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set*.

## Contents

Project consists of these files:

- `README.md`
- `run_analysis.R` - R script with functions to prepare tidy dataset
- `CodeBook.md` - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data

## Usage

To prepare a tidy dataset perform the following steps:

1. Start R console or R studio.
2. Set working directory to the dir of repository.
3. Load functions from R script:

  `> source('run_analysis.R')`

4. Run main function:
